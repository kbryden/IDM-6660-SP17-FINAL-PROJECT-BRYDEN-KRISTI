            <h3>Breeding</h3>
            <p>A mare’s estrus cycle occurs when the length of daylight is long, and natural estrous (entire cycle) begins in the spring. However, mares can be placed under artificial lights as early as December to prepare them for the beginning of breeding season in February.</p>
            <p>The covering process varies depending on the stallion and behavior of the mare. Trained personnel handle both the stallion and mare during the mating process, and many times mares are restrained and protected to prevent injury. An experienced stallion will cover a mare in a few minutes. Other stallions are quirky and may balk at certain types of mares (some stallions will not cover grey mares for instance). Once complete, the mare loads back up and goes home. It’s worth noting that every single cover has to be a live cover. There is no artificial insemination with registered Thoroughbreds.</p>
            <p>A pregnancy can be diagnosed using ultrasound about 14 days after ovulation. If a mare does not conceive, she will come back into heat 14-16 days after the end of the last heat period. Sometimes mares return more than once to be bred, but with any luck and skill, it only takes one time. With quality care and some help from Mother Nature, a foal will be born 11 months later.</p>

            <h3>Training</h3>
            <p>The range of training techniques and training goals is large, but basic animal training concepts apply to all forms of horse training. The initial goal of most types of training is to create a horse that is safe for humans to handle (under most circumstances) and able to perform a useful task for the benefit of humans.</p>
            <p>A few specific considerations and some basic knowledge of horse behavior helps a horse trainer be effective no matter what school or discipline is chosen:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Safety is paramount: Horses are much larger and stronger than humans, so must be taught behavior that will not injure people.</li>
              <li>Horses, like other animals, differ in brain structure from humans and thus do not have the same type of thinking and reasoning ability as human beings. Thus, the human has the responsibility to think about how to use the psychology of the horse to lead the animal into an understanding of the goals of the human trainer.</li>
              <li>Horses are social herd animals and, when properly handled, can learn to follow and respect a human leader.</li>
              <li>Horses, as prey animals, have an inborn fight or flight instinct that has to be adapted to human needs. Horses need to be taught to rely upon humans to determine when fear or flight is an appropriate response to new stimuli and not to react by instinct alone.</li>
              <li>Like most animals, a young horse will more easily adapt to human expectations than an older one, so human handling of the horse from a very early age is generally advised.</li>
            </ul>
