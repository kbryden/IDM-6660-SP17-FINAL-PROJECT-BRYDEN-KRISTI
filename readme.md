What will the content of your new site be?

Iron Horse Performance needs a website to provide easily accessible information to their customers. The website will help promote breeding, training, horse services such as Equi-resp and laser-treatment, mares and geldings for sale, and contact information. All pricing will be provided by contact only. The site will not post any prices.

If not, what sort of design do you envision, (columns, fluid/static layout, images, ect...)?

The site will have six main pages: breeding, training, experience, services, horses for sale, and contact. Each of these pages will feature high-res beautiful images, clean-inviting copy, and useful information pertaining to the main focus of the page. These main pages will have a fluid layout with the exception of the horses for sale page. This page will need a grid/column design in order to feature multiple horses on the same page.


What new technology, (if any), would you want to experiment with?
How do you envision using that technology?

I really want to perfect the grid layout. I sort of shy away from this in my own designs.

I also want to use Javascript and JQuery for this site. I haven't used it all semester. Atleast, nothing new. I've just been reusing old code for things. I would really like to play with animations and this PDF plugin I found on Github for displaying PDFs. Especially, since my client wants to emphasize the paperwork for her horse. I need to do some research on other horse websites to make sure that having the original paperwork online is a good idea.

Techniques and Technology

Grid systems and columns look pretty easy on closer inspection. It will be fun to implement one on my responsive design. Just div it up and then give them a grid class name col-1, etc.

I am considering using Javascript to do my PDF display. It's not required but I will have fun figuring out which technique I want to use.

I also want to do something creative with Javascript. I am having a little trouble finding articles on how to use Javascript creatively. The animate on scroll function sounds like it could be fun. I'm not that great at Javascript so no promises on this creative path.
